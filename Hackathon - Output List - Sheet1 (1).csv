LinkedIn",37315,"1. Consider local gigs: While major markets like New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago might offer more opportunities, they're also home to a greater number of actors. These cities are very competitive, and it could be beneficial to start your career in a smaller city and gain more experience before moving. Check local websites and businesses for information about local theaters in your area where you can gain some initial experience as an actor. 
2. Take acting classes: There are a number of different workshops and camps in which you can enroll. The important thing is to get started. Acting instructors can help you develop your technique, improve your confidence and gain some general knowledge before your first auditions.
3. Further your formal education: Once you have some foundational knowledge, start looking for more formal education. You can find acting teachers in a variety of different places. Research local community colleges and universities that offer night classes to identify one that works for your schedule. This may also help you gain valuable experience since you may be able to participate in student films, commercials and media projects.
4. Join a local theater: Your community theater is a valuable place to get started. You can build your confidence while mastering the basics, forming relationships with other actors and becoming familiar with personnel who are integral to production, like costume designers, lighting technicians and script supervisors.
5. Learn about the industry: Read the Hollywood trade magazines, either in print on online, and learn the names of the top talent agents and production companies. Attend industry events, even if you’re not in Los Angeles or New York, and network with other people who aspire to work in the industry.
6. Build your resume: As you pursue education and gain relevant acting experience, start assembling your resume so that you're ready to apply for acting jobs. Resumes that include acting and non-acting experience, like writing and directing, can help you stand out to potential casting decision-makers. When you do gain some experience as an actor and begin writing your resume, include the names of the plays, musicals, films, commercials or TV shows you participated in and the roles that you played.
7. Get a professional headshot: Casting agents will require headshots and audition tapes so it’s important to hire the best photographers you can afford. Physical appearance is important for a visual industry like acting, where television and film are the primary mediums.
8. Start auditioning: One of the best ways to start as an actor once you have all the required materials is to go to auditions. This way, you can gain some experience throughout various auditioning processes and if you get any roles, then you can gain additional experience to add to your resume. When first starting as an actor, you may focus more on creating work rather than getting paid, but there may exist opportunities for new actors to receive payment for their work in various types of roles.

Microsoft Office SharePoint Server MOSS",135740,"1. Earn a bachelor's degree: You'll need to have a bachelor's degree to apply for law school. Law schools accept students with a wide range of degrees. However, some of the most common undergraduate majors include criminal justice, English, economics, philosophy and political science.
Spend your undergraduate time taking classes related to the area of law you think you would like to practice. For example, if you want to practice corporate law, you should take more business courses. The purpose of your undergraduate degree is to give yourself a strong, wide base of knowledge and to explore your interests.
2. Take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT): After earning your bachelor's degree, your next step is to take the LSAT. It consists of five multiple-choice sections that cover topics such as reading comprehension, critical thinking and argumentation, and each section needs to be completed in 35 minutes.
It’s administered at a testing location on a specific date through electronic tablets. After the in-person exam, you’ll also need to complete a written portion that you can submit online from home.
Law school admissions officers will review your LSAT scores and undergraduate history to determine if you’d be a good fit for the program. Many undergraduate students take the LSAT at the end of their junior year so they have enough time to submit law school applications.
It’s beneficial to prepare for the LSAT before taking it. The LSAT tests your skills first and foremost, and it’s a good idea to take practice exams so you can understand the types of questions and how to answer them.
You should spend several months reviewing materials and conducting practice tests before you take the LSAT. The better you perform, the higher chance you have of getting into a top-tier law school.
3. Apply to law school: Once you've received your LSAT scores, you can begin applying to law schools. Most students apply to several law schools so they have a few options to choose from. For each application you send, you'll need to submit official transcripts, LSAT scores, letters of recommendation and additional information.
Many schools seek candidates with high LSAT scores, excellent letters of recommendation and extracurricular activities. Completing an internship at your local courthouse or law firm can further show your dedication to the field. Volunteering with a group in your community can demonstrate your eagerness to learn.
4. Earn a Juris Doctor degree
Once you graduate from law school, you’ll earn a J.D. It takes an average of three years to complete a doctorate in law. Each school has its own curriculum and guidelines for graduation.
In the first two years of law school, you'll typically complete coursework in general studies. During your final year, you can usually take elective courses to start focusing on a specific area of law. Some courses you can expect to take while earning your J.D. are:
- Constitutional law
- Courtroom procedures
- Criminal law
- Civil law
- International law
- Torts
- Property and real estate law
5. Pass the bar examination: The last step in becoming a lawyer is passing the bar examination for whichever state you’d like to practice law in. For example, if you want to become a lawyer in New York, you’ll need to pass the New York State Bar Exam.
While there are some variations from state to state, the bar exam is usually a two-day test. On the first day, you’ll complete the Multistate Bar Examination, and the second day consists of a written exam portion.
Preparing for the bar exam requires a lot of studying. You should create a study schedule that takes place over several months. You’ll also want to find a quality bar exam test preparation course and materials to help, and focus your attention on topics that appear frequently.
After completing the test, the state's bar examiners will consider your test scores along with your educational background, character and ability to represent others in legal matters. Should they find you acceptable in all these categories, you will then receive your law license.

Most statees require that you graduate from an ABA-accredited law school, pass one or more written bar exams, and be found by an admitting board to have the character to represent and advise others.

QSR International NVivo",98590,"1. Complete an undergraduate degree: The first step in becoming a sociologist involves obtaining a degree, such as a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology that includes coursework in sociology, social statistics, research methods and social theory. Candidates can also opt for degrees in other disciplines, such as anthropology, psychology or political science, as these are all concerned with human behavior and overlap with the field of sociology. An undergraduate degree typically requires four years of study.
2. Choose a career field: Before you continue your studies, decide whether you want a career in academia, which entails working as a professor or as an independent researcher at a university or an institute, or if you want to enter the workforce.
Studying sociology equips candidates with many useful skills, such as designing research projects, collecting and interpreting data and experience in working with data analysis software. You could apply these skills in many careers, such as those in:
- Business
- Higher education, both in teaching or student services
- Social services
- Government agencies
- Nonprofits
- Scientific research and development services
- Management, scientific and technical consulting services
3. Obtain a master's degree: Once you reach the graduate level, you can choose one of two available programs: traditional or applied. A traditional master's program prepares candidates for a Ph.D. and is the applicable educational path for those who aim to teach at universities or colleges or want to conduct independent research. Candidates who want to enter the workforce should opt for an applied master's degree.
Master's programs vary in requirements and focus but most programs consist of a core set of foundational courses and a thesis or independent research component. The core coursework typically includes classical and contemporary theory, research methodology and statistical analysis. A master's degree typically takes two years of full-time study to complete.
3. Gain practical experience: Master's programs typically provide students with opportunities to gain practical experience through internships. Students who are enrolled in a traditional master's program may work as an assistant for a research sociologist, whereas a candidate who is completing an applied master's degree could conduct interviews for a marketing company.
4. Opt for a Ph.D.: Candidates who wish to enter the world of academia, whether as a lecturer or a researcher, may need to complete a doctoral degree. A Ph.D. program typically focuses on sociological theories and research methods and becoming familiar with the work of important theorists and sociologists. After students have completed their coursework and demonstrated their knowledge in an exam, they write a dissertation that must contain original research. A Ph.D. normally takes between three to four years to complete.
5. Get certified: You can enhance your career by adding certification to your qualifications. The Association for Applied and Clinical Sociology awards two different certifications, including:
- Certified Sociological Practitioner: This certification is given to candidates who have demonstrated their competency as sociological practitioners in the fields of applied, clinical or engaged public sociology.
- Certified Clinical Sociologist: This designation is for sociologists who have applied sociological perspectives and analysis to affect positive social change.
Applicants for both certifications must either hold a master's or a Ph.D. and submit a portfolio that includes their practice background, current practice, ethical position and recommendations from people that know them as practitioners. Selected applicants must give a presentation before final approval. If the panel approves the application, the applicant becomes a certified member and can add the designation to their qualifications."

Surgery workflow communication software",57290,"1. Choose a preliminary career path: Some surgical assistants may start out as surgical technicians, registered nurses or physician assistants. You will need to choose one of these professions, enroll in the appropriate program and obtain a degree
2. Meet certain education requirements: You will need to earn an associate degree or bachelor's degree in a related medical field as a prerequisite. There will likely be a 3.0 minimum grade point average (GPA) requirement.
3. Gain experience in the surgical field: After obtaining your degree, you will need to find a job that allows you to work in operating rooms. Depending on the surgical assisting program you apply to, you will likely need to have at least three years of operating room experience. Alternatively, if you have experience as a military medic, you may also qualify for a surgical assisting program.
4. Enroll in a surgical assisting program: During your instruction, you will learn about microbiology, anesthesia and pharmacology, among other related fields. A surgical assisting program will take 10 to 22 months to complete and you will receive a certificate, but you will need to meet even more stringent requirements. Additionally, you will need to pass a physical exam, earn certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), obtain health insurance, receive vaccinations, and pass a drug test.
5. Earn certification: Certification is required for surgical assistants. You can receive certification through one of three organizations:
The National Board of Surgical Technology and Surgical Assisting (NBSTSA)
The National Surgical Assistant Association (NSAA)
The American Board of Surgical Assistants (ABSA).
You will have to renew your certification every two years for the NSAA or ABSA and after January 1, 2020, surgical assistants who received their certification from the NBSTSA will need to recertify every two years."

Vetport",103260,"1. Earn a Bachelor of Science degree in a relevant field: After graduating from high school, earn an undergraduate degree in chemistry, biology, animal biology, zoology or other related scientific studies. Most undergraduate programs take four years to complete and include classes in areas that can prepare you for veterinary programs, such as math, writing and advanced science classes. Check with veterinary programs to find prerequisite and required courses for vet school so you're prepared to enter a DVM program once you graduate college.
2. Apply for veterinary school: The next step to starting a career as a vet is to apply and gain admission at an accredited veterinary school. Most vet programs include four years of study encompassing coursework and hands-on clinical experience to earn your Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM). You also pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE) to complete your degree. Some veterinary schools require aspiring veterinarians to complete previous work experience in veterinary clinics or gain experience dealing with animals in an animal shelter, farm, stable or similar environment.
3. Pass licensure exams: Once you've earned your DVM degree, you can apply for licensure in the state where you plan to practice. The process includes passing a certification exam supported by the American Association of Veterinary State Boards (AAVSB). Veterinary school can prepare you for the exam, but independent study can help you strengthen your knowledge and complete practice exam questions.
4. Complete an internship or residency: Many veterinarians choose to complete an internship or residency with a seasoned veterinarian once they obtain a license. This allows new veterinarians to practice with supervision before opening a practice or working independently at an existing practice. Most internships or residencies last for a year and provide opportunities for new vets to learn more about the administrative, business and operational side of veterinary practice. This may include clinical rotations, which give you the opportunity to try out various specializations.
5. Work toward a specialization: Just like traditional medicine, veterinarians can choose to specialize in areas like anesthesia and surgery. Vets may complete in-depth studies in over 40 specialties in animal care and medical treatment. A specialization program can take two or three years to complete, depending on the area of practice.
6. Gain board certification: Finally, some veterinarians choose to become board certified. Board certification is a designation for veterinarians with advanced or specialized training who've passed a rigorous exam demonstrating their knowledge. Each specialty has its organization that administers certification. Board certification is not required to be a practicing veterinarian.
